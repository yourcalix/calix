      # NOTICE: Uploading local translations to Crowdin can overwrite remote changes and discard pending sync work. Run only when intentionally pushing the repo state upstream. See https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi/pull/813#issuecomment-3669328994 and https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/github-integration/ (explained by @typed-sigterm); Mastodon follows a similar flow.
