      # First discovered by [@gg582](https://github.com/gg582) in https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi/pull/647
      #
      # Without the correct zypak-wrapper, application launch will result in this error:
      # content/browser/zygote_host/zygote_host_impl_linux.cc:132] No usable sandbox! ... If you want to live
      # dangerously and need an immediate workaround, you can try using --no-sandbox.
      #
      # Though https://github.com/refi64/chromium-tar/blob/82ebd6a0473341fa75dd3bbb2f584da99f5ac92c/content/browser/zygote_host/zygote_host_impl_linux.cc#L104-L131
      # suggests that the error is related to missing switch of service_manager::switches::kDisableNamespaceSandbox and
      # service_manager::switches::kDisableSetuidSandbox, even if we add --no-sandbox to the command, the application basically
      # exits immediately without any error message and traces.
      #
      # When searching for solutions, I spotted the session-desktop issue below looks exactly the same and
      # they managed to resolve it by renaming the executable command with -app suffix, however the wrapper
      # called zypak-wrapper is the key to resolve this issue:
      # https://github.com/session-foundation/session-desktop/issues/795
      # https://github.com/flathub/network.loki.Session/pull/32
      #
      # Similar keywords appears in the official docs of Flatpak as well:
      # https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/electron.html#launching-the-app
      #
      # With the correct way to research, I found several examples of Electron apps using zypak-wrapper:
      # https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/issues/1597#issuecomment-3272020725
      # https://github.com/vendillah/app.Chainner.chainner/blob/main/app.chainner.Chainner.yaml
      #
      # and bitwarden, as the most popular password manager app, it's architecture and bundle workflow looked
      # almost the same as ours, most of the structure of this manifest is based on bitwarden's:
      # https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/blob/b8d55c4db178de67f1778bc307f7c22aad01f4a9/apps/desktop/resources/com.bitwarden.desktop.devel.yaml
