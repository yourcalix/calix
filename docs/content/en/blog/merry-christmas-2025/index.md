I know we are a bit late here, but we are working on this from day to day, night to night, almost consuming my
24 hours, 7 days a week, all working on this project, audio is still having issues with multiple integration and providers,
model driver is still being experimented, while we finished Minecraft & Factorio way earlier this year, the channel that bridges these
integrations were still broken and many were untested, but at least we are pushing this forward, with better architecture, plugins,
and presets, skills, etc. New DevLog is on the way too, so stay tuned.

2025 pushed us, especially [me (Neko)](https://github.com/nekomeowww) to way beyond what we could imagine a year ago. This kind of progress
cannot be achieved alone, without you.

Just hours ago, we saw that on X, [KOL @Dexerto](https://x.com/Dexerto) posted [this](https://x.com/Dexerto/status/2003579088003346501):

> AI powered VTuber Neuro-sama has broken her own record for the biggest Hype Train of all time on Twitch.
>
> She reached level 123 with over 110,000 subs and more than 1,000,000 bits.

Happy birthday, Neuro-sama. And congratulations to you, creator of Vedal, also, artist Camila. It's unbelievable you made this
far, it is you, and also the Swarm brought me here wishing to deliver my version of cyber life, continuously making AIRI to grow.
